Hi!

I am **Joowon Lee**, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I am interested in the fields of causal inference and machine learning. More specifically, my research interest is in developing individual treatment rules which recommend optimal treatment according to individual characteristics. I seek methods that can give *interpretable* results so that they can be widely used and communicated with professionals in broad areas.

As a former nurse, I love to help individual patients to improve their health conditions. However, my ultimate goal is to develop novel statistical methods for medical and public health studies, aiming for the overall improvement of public health status.
