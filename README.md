Hi!

I am **Joowon Lee**, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I am interested in the fields of machine learning and causal inference, especially finding individual treatment rule using the most recent machine learning techniques. You may find my current work related to * *supervised dictionary learning (SDL)* * [here](https://github.com/ljw9510/SDL), which is a novel statistical method for finding class-discriminative dictionaries to perform supervised learning in the framework of dictionary learning.

I earned my B.S. in Statistics and Nursing, and master in Statistics at Seoul National Unversity in South Korea. Before joining UW-Madison, I worked as an emergency room nurse at Hyundai Asan medical center in South Korea and joined various projects including patient safety, finding susceptible gene related to pancreatic cancer by dealing with clinical data, microarray, and sequencing data.

I love helping individual patients to improve their health condition, however, my ultimate goal is to develop novel statistical methods for medical and public health studies, aiming for the oveerall improvement of public health status. 



types of jobs or internships you are interested in.

Why are you interested in causal inference?
